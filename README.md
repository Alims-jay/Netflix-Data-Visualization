# Netflix-Data-Visualization

Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes Netflix data using Python and R. It includes:

•	Data cleaning and preparation

•	Visualizations for most-watched genres and ratings distribution

•	Implementation of one visualization in R

Dataset
The dataset used is Netflix_shows_movies_cleaned.csv, which contains details about Netflix content, including title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and genre.

Requirements
The following libraries both python and R were installed:

•	Python Libraries:

•	pandas

•	matplotlib

•	seaborn

•	R Libraries:

•	ggplot2

•	dplyr

•	tidyr

Running the Python Code
Open the Jupyter Notebook Netflix Data Visualization.ipynb.
Ensure the dataset Netflix_shows_movies_cleaned.csv is in the same directory.
Run the notebook to generate:
A bar chart for Most Watched Genres
A count plot for Ratings Distribution



Running the R Code
Open Netflix r visualization.R in RStudio.
Ensure the dataset Netflix_shows_movies_cleaned.csv is in the working directory.
Run the script to generate a bar chart for Most Watched Genres using ggplot2.

Interpretation of Visualizations
The dataset has been pre-cleaned to handle missing values.
Most Watched Genres: Displays the top 10 genres based on their occurrence in the dataset.
Ratings Distribution: Shows the count of different content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13).
The R visualization is an alternative approach to confirm insights from Python.
